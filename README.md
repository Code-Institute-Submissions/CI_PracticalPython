# A Curious Cottage
#### A century-old riddle
For this project, I decided to combine my affection for games and novels. I am working on a little interactive short story set in an old, dusty cottage.
## UX
 
- This website is for gamers, visual novel or choose-your-own story readers, mystery novels fans, people with 10 minutes to spare.
- User stories!!
-  [Hypertext fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_fiction)
-  [Gamebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook)
    A gamebook is a work of printed fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making choices. The narrative branches along various paths, typically through the use of numbered paragraphs or pages. Gamebooks are sometimes called choose your own adventure books or CYOA after the influential Choose Your Own Adventure series originally published by US company Bantam Books. Gamebooks influenced hypertext fiction.[1]

> Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
     - As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
> ## Features
> In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
- Story
- Interactivity [Interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)
- Leaderboard to display progress of the reader in the story
 
#### Existing Features
> - Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out ...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
> #### Features Left to Implement
>- Another feature idea
## Technologies Used
> In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [Python version 3]()
    - Lorem.
- [Flask]()
    - [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    - Flask plugins? (requirements...)
- [Jinja2]()
    - Lorem.
- [Html & CSS]()
    - Lorem.
## Testing
>In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
> 1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This project has been deployed using Heroku.
#### [A Curious Cottage](https://ci-vero-practicalpython.herokuapp.com/)

- [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)
    - The ‘Deploy to Heroku’ button enables users to deploy apps to Heroku without leaving the web browser, and with little or no configuration. The button is ideal for customers, open-source project maintainers or add-on providers who wish to provide their customers with a quick and easy way to deploy and configure a Heroku app.
The button is well-suited for use in README files, and is intended to serve as a replacement to a list of manual steps typically required to configure an app.



>This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
>- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
>- Different configuration files?
>- Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
