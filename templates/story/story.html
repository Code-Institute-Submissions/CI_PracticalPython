            <p> You see your neighbour waving from the street. You just helped her find her son's rattle under a pile of
                twigs.</p>
            <p>In the neighbourhood, you are known for your inquisitive mind and problem-solving skills. You have
                uncovered more local mysteries than you can count (maths was
                never your forte anyways). You are not a private investigator, but you could be, if you worked up the courage to
                apply for a permit. You know investigating is not a glamorous endeavour. </p>

                <p>Your trusty
                <strong>{{ color }} </strong> umbrella
                in hand, you have braved spittle and deluge, dark basements and smelly back alleys
                whenever called for help. Really, it would be
                right in calling you a <strong>{{ mystical }}</strong> among civilians, such is your talent and
                dedication to puzzles. But to switch career from a gardener to a proper PI, to have your own agency and wear a fedora all day... You can only dream.</p>

            <p>One sunny day, while you are artfully pruning a shrub in front of your house, you are approached by an
                elderly couple, Greta and Paul McMillan, friends of your parents. They have heard of your investigative talent and ask you for help
                regarding
                the most unusual of situations.</p>
            <p> They have inherited a little cottage in the countryside from relatives. Beside being a little spooky and
                dusty, it is quite charming and the couple wishes to use it as a summer house. </p>
            <p>Recently, the McMillans went into the cottage to tidy it up. It looked like a scene straight out of the
                early 20th century; the previous house owners had left furniture and
                decorations intact.
                 As the McMillans walked in, their big dog MontaguÃ« bumped into the dining table, from which a vase fall down. Within its debris, there was a note: </p>
