        <p> You approach the house, led by the McMillans. They have told you on the way the cottage was home to
            Mrs McMillan's great-grandparents (the Thomases) close to a century ago. She presumes the riddle was left by
            her
            great-grandfather Mr Thomas, a journalist.
        <p> Apparently, he would have received an assignment requiring his presence in America, for which he left Europe
            and never
            returned.
            Mrs Thomas would have followed him not too long after.</p>
        <p> While the McMillans wait outside with their enthusiastic dog, you step into the house through the front
            door, which is quite low.
            To your surprise, the house has electric
            lighting, so a flick
            of the hand is all that is needed to illuminate the room. The light is still a bit dim.</p>
        <p> You take in the cottage's antique charm. Its roof's wooden beams are exposed and are higher than you would
            have thought. The tiny windows are south-facing and allow for some natural light to shine in.
            From your position by the entrance, you confirm there is only one big room in the house. To focus on each important feature of the house, you divide this room in three sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The entrance of the house  - delimited by the kitchen area, where a dining table stands under a few
                small windows on the left, and a dining server sits at the right.
            </li>
            <li>A sitting area - where, at the back of the room, bookshelves, two comfy chairs and a low table surround the kitchen stove.
            </li>
            <li>A sleeping area - farthest from the door, where a bed is partially hidden behind a curtain and a chest of drawers.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>You assume that the privy is adjacent to
            the
            house
            considering the room's
            small size.</p>

        <h3>What do you do next?</h3>
        <p>
            <button data-toggle=".dining" class="btns">You approach the dining table</button>
            <div class="dining">
        <p>The dining table is covered by a tablecloth with an odd pattern. There is a slight bump under the cloth.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <button data-toggle=".tablecloth" class="btns">Lift the tablecloth</button>

                <div class="tablecloth">
                    <p>There is a bundle of sewing patterns. You can see one of them is meant for a wedding dress. There
                        is an
                        handwritten note on it: 'must be red, not white'.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>

        You are impressed by the well-organised room in front of you. Reasonably, the Thomases had set up their
        sleeping and rest areas to benefit from the heat of the stove. Everything within easy
        reach of the front door is related to the kitchen, and to the storage of goods and housewares. All items are
        arranged impeccably under a layer of dust. There is no waste of space in the room.

        My obligations won't keep me away
        from you too long, I dare hope. I left a treasure for you to find, my love, if you come to miss me. It is hidden
        where:

        <ul>
            <li>Time stops for our battles of wit.</li>
            <li>White clad or not, you are a queen.</li>
            <li>You inspire my every action.</li>
            <li>I move brazenly towards you.</li>
            <li>But you know how to stop my foolish plans.</li>
            <li>I kneel in front of your beauty.</li>
            <li>And carry the image of you with me.</li>
