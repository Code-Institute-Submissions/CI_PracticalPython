        <p> You approach the house, led by the McMillans. They have told you on the way the cottage was home to
            Mrs. McMillan's great-grandparents close to a century ago. She presumes the riddle was left by her
            great-grandfather, a journalist.
        <p> Apparently, he would have received an assignment requiring his presence in America, for which he left Europe
            and never
            returned.
            His wife would have followed him not too long after.</p>
        <p> While the McMillans wait outside with their enthusiastic dog, you step into the house through the front
            door, which is quite low.
            To your surprise, the house has electric
            lighting, so a flick
            of the hand is all that is needed to illuminate the room. The light is still a bit dim.</p>
        <p> You take in the cottage's antique charm. Its roof's wooden beams are exposed and are higher than you would
            have thought. The tiny windows are south-facing and allow for some natural light to shine in.
            From your position by the entrance, you can see the only room of the house is divided in three sections.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> A kitchen area, closest to the entrance's wall, is set under a few
                small windows with a narrow counter space. The dining table and its two chairs sit between the sections.
            </li>
            <li>A sitting area at the back of the room surrounds the kitchen stove and consists of bookshelves with a
                few
                couches and a low table.
            </li>
            <li>Alongside it, farthest from the door is the sleeping
                area, partially hidden behind a curtain and a chest of drawers.

            </li>


        </ul>
        <p>You assume that the privy is adjacent to
            the
            house
            considering the room's
            small size.</p>
        <p>
            <button id="btn_dining" class="btns">You approach the dining table</button>
            <div class="dining">
        <p>The dining table is covered by a tablecloth with an odd pattern. There is a slight bump under the cloth.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <button id="btn_tablecloth" class="btns">Lift the tablecloth</button>

                <div class="tablecloth">
                    <p>There is a bundle of sewing patterns. You can see one of them is meant for a wedding dress. There
                        is an
                        handwritten note on it: 'must be red, not white'.</p>

        You are impressed by the well-organised room in front of you. Clearly, the inhabitants had set up their
        sleeping and rest areas as to benefit from the heat of the stove. Everything within easy
        reach of the front door is related to the kitchen, and to the storage of goods and houseware. All items are
        arranged impeccably under a layer of dust.
