        <p> You approach the house, led by the McMillans. They have told you on the way the cottage was home to
            Mrs. McMillan's great-grandparents in the early 1930s. She presumes the riddle was left by her
            great-grandfather, a journalist.
        <p> Apparently, he had an assignment requiring his presence in America, for which he left Europe and never
            returned.
            His wife would have followed him not too long after.</p>
        <p> You step into the house through the front door, which is quite low, while the McMillans wait outside.
            To your surprise, the house has electric
            lighting, so a flick
            of the hand is all that is needed to illuminate the room. The light is still a bit dim.</p>
        <p> You take in the cottage's antique charm. Its roof's wooden beams are exposed and are higher than you would
            have thought.
            From your position by the entrance, you can see the only room of the house is divided in three sections.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A sitting area at the back of the room surrounds the kitchen stove, and consists of bookshelves with a
                few
                couches and a low table.
            </li>
            <li> A kitchen area, closest to the entrance's wall, is set under a few
                small windows with a narrow counter space. The dining table and its two chairs sit between the sections.
            </li>
            <li>Farthest from the door is the sleeping
                area, partially hidden behind a curtain and a chest of drawers. You assume that the privy is adjacent to
                the
                house
                considering the room's
                small size.
            </li>
        </ul>

                <p>There is a bundle of sewing patterns. You can see one of them is meant for a wedding dress. There is an
                    handwritten note on it: 'must be red, not white'.</p>

        You are impressed by the well-organised room in front of you. Clearly, the inhabitants had set up their
        sleeping and rest areas as to benefit from the heat of the stove. Everything within easy
        reach of the front door is related to the kitchen, and to the storage of goods and houseware. All items are
        arranged impeccably under a layer of dust.
