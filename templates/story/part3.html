        <h1> PART3 -- You've done the round</h1>

        <p>You walk to the side of the bed. You look under it and find a chest. There are also some hat boxes under the bed.
         </p>
        <p> At the head and feet of the bed, the chests of drawers stand tall. The bookshelf, adjacent to the bed, is filled up with books. Some mathematical tomes seem particularly worn.
        A globe and an atlas are stored side by side. The atlas has a few newspapers clippings inserted. More newspapers are piled up neatly alongside various tomes. </p>
<p>Over the bookshelves, there are picture frames with annotations.</p>
        <p>Within range of the bookshelves, the comfortable cushioned chairs show a lot of wear and tear. They are closely positioned to the low table. This table has a recognizable pattern on it.</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Open the chest<p>
                A bouquet of dried up red roses is laid on a carefully folded wedding dress. Its white lace has been yellowed over time.
            Under the dress, there is a pair of gloves and some fancy shoes. Being a gardener, you do not know much about fashion, but you think this was a very trendy outfit for a Victorian wedding.

                        src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/picture3.png') }}" alt="Who is this?"></p>
                <p>The picture frames are as follows: a,b,chess champion vera.
                The notes identify each image accordingly: a,b,chess champion vera. You recognise that the two people sitting in the last picture are the same as the ones on the wedding portrait. More accurately, the picture seems to have been taken in this very room, and you see the low table by the stove remains unchanged.</p>

                <p><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/chessboard.png') }}" alt="It is missing a piece?"></p>
                <p>You identify the pattern on the low table as a chessboard. As a gardener, you know very little of chess, beside for the basic pieces and their starting positions. There is a piece missing and the queen is in the wrong position on the white side.</p>

                <p>There are various chess-related books. You find that an article clipping regarding Vera Menchik's latest championship. There are more than one article piled up where you can find her name.</p>
                <p>You see there is a chesspiece in the bookshelf, it is a white knight. </p>
