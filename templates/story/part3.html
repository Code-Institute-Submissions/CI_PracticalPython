        <h1> 3.</h1>

        <p>Happy with your observations so far, you walk to the side of the house closest to the kitchen stove. The only
            bed of the house is isolated not only by a curtain, but by two tall chests of drawers.The curtain is heavy
            with dust and you make the mistake of opening it brusquely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Against the northern wall are two bookshelves crammed with books and papers.Three annotated picture frames
            hang over the bookshelves.
            A globe and an atlas are stored side by side on the bookshelf closest to the kitchen stove. The atlas pages are open on the American continent section.
            The other bookshelf contains newspapers piled up neatly alongside various tomes. They seem particularly
            worn. </p>
        <p>Within hands' reach of the bookshelves, two comfortable-looking chairs show a lot of wear and tear. They
            are
            closely positioned to the low table. There are tracks on the floor showing the table and chairs were moved
            often.</p>

        <p>
            <button id="btn_under_the_bed" class="btns">You look under the bed</button>
        </p>
        <div class="under_the_bed">Coughing heavily and cursing
            your impatience, you look under the bed frame and spot a
            wooden chest. There are also some hat boxes and plenty of dust bunnies rolling about.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <button id="btn_chest" class="btns">Open the chest</button>

                    <div class="chest">
                        <p>A bouquet of dried up red roses is laid on a carefully folded wedding dress. Its
                            white lace
                            has been yellowed over time.
                            Under the dress, there is a pair of gloves and some fancy shoes. Being a down-to-earth,
                            unprivileged
                            gardener, you
                            do not know much
                            about fashion, but you think this was a very respectable garment for a wedding a century
                            ago.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            <button id="btn_paintings" class="btns">Observe the paintings</button>
        </p>
        <div class="paintings">
            <p><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/picture2.png') }}" alt="Vera Menchik Club"> <img
                    src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/picture1.png') }}" alt="My Queen"> <img
                    src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/picture3.png') }}" alt="Battle in Black and White"></p>
            <p>The picture frames are identified as follows: Vera Menchik Club; My Queen; Battle in Black and White.
                You recognise that the two people
                sitting in the last picture are the same as the ones on the wedding portrait. More accurately, the
                picture seems to have been taken in this very room, and you see the low table by the kitchen stove
                matches
                the picture as well.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <button id="btn_chessboard" class="btns">Sit in a cushy chair</button>

        <div class="chessboard">
            <p><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/chessboard.png') }}" alt="It is missing a piece?"></p>
            <p>Carefully in case the chair's cushions are filled with dust, you sit down by the stove. You quickly
                identify the pattern on the low table in front of you. Of course! It is a chessboard table, with drawers
                where to store its pieces
                on each side. You admit to know very little of chess,
                but you recognize the basic pieces and you know how to set the board.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <button id="btn_missing" class="btns">Something is amiss</button>

                        <div class="missing">
            <p>The board is already set in this case. However, there is a piece missing on the white player' side -- a
                knight. The white queen is occupying its spot.</p>

    <div class="bookshelf">
        <p><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/library.png') }}" alt="So many books"></p>
        <p>You kneel by the bookshelf to review the available titles. There are various chess-related books and a few
            hourglasses. There are copies of the <strong>British Chess Magazine</strong>
            and an article clipping from the<strong> New York Times</strong> regarding the Carlsbad 1929 chess
            tournament. There are numerous articles piled up captioning interviews of famous chessmasters.
        </p>
        <p>There is also a white knight sitting atop a newspaper clipping. The clipping has been scribbled over. </p>
