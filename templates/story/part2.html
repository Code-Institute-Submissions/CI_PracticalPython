        <hr>
        <p>You have a cursory look around at the kitchen area. There is a narrow counter top under the windows and the
            dining room server, nothing out of the ordinary. You wonder how bothersome it was to take care of the dishes
            a century ago. You certainly are fond of the amenities offered by modern plumbing.</p>

        <p>Your eyes notice an old clock on the wall closest to the dining table. Beside being a gardener,
            you are fond of antiques and this pendulum clock charms you immediately. It is a well-preserved timepiece
            from the Victorian Era, however it does not seem to be ticking.</p>
        <p>You know that clocks have a steady 'tick-tock' sounds not unlike a metronome when they are working properly.
        </p>

        <p> As you stand next to the clock, you take note across the room above the dining room server is a wedding
            portrait. It is so big actually, you wonder how it did not jump to your attention when you came in.
        </p>

            <p> As you like tinkering with broken things, you know from experience that, if a pendulum clock keeps
                stopping, it could be due to its position leading to a weight imbalance.
                You think the clock is not quite level, so you poke at it with enthusiasm. Once satisfied that the clock
                is no longer leaning to the left or right, or at an angle, you start the pendulum swinging
                and wait to see if the metronome-like ticking is triggered.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <button id="btn_clock_inside" class="btns">The clock is still not ticking</button>

                    <div class="clock_inside">
                        <p>Even if the clock is straightened, the pendulum still does not move. Confused, you open the
                            clock's pendulum door to examine its innards.
                            You gasp! There is a sheet wedged against the pendulum. </p>
                        <p>As you unfold it, you see the sheet of paper is referring to some kind of maths problem (you
                            grimace). There are handwritten notes and question
                            marks and it looks like the note was ripped off a newspaper.</p>

            <p>You have a close look at the wedding picture. The lady on the left has a beautiful white dress and
                the man looks a bit stiff in his fancy outfit. The picture has aged well and is enclosed in an
                elaborated wooden frame.
                The frame is bulky and is hung securely on the wall.

            <p>You call in the McMillans to ask if they know who is the couple in the portrait. Greta McMillan
                confirms the couple was indeed her relatives on their wedding day. She does not remember much about
                them. </p>
