        <h2> 2</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>By now, you examine your surrounding with a methodical eye. You observe the kitchen area where you currently stand. There is a narrow counter top under the windows and the
            dining room server, nothing out of the ordinary. You wonder how bothersome it was to take care of the dishes
            a century ago. You certainly are fond of the amenities offered by modern plumbing.</p>

        <p>Your eyes pick up an old clock on the wall closest to the dining table. Beside being a gardener,
            you are fond of antiques and this pendulum clock charms you immediately. It is a well-preserved timepiece
            from the Victorian Era. However, as you get closer to it, it does not seem to be ticking.
            You know that clocks have a steady 'tick-tock' sounds not unlike a metronome when they are working properly.
        </p>

        <p> As you stand next to the clock, you take note that across the room above the dining room server, there is a
            wedding
            portrait. In fact, it is so imposing that you wonder how it did not capture your attention when you came in.
        </p>

            <button data-toggle=".clock_view" class="btns">You try to fix the clock</button>

            <p> As you like tinkering with broken things, you know from experience that, if a pendulum clock has
                stopping, it could be due to its position.
                You think the clock is not quite level, so you poke at it with enthusiasm. Once satisfied that the clock
                is no longer leaning to the left or right, or at an angle, you expect the pendulum to start swinging again
                and wait to see if the metronome-like ticking is triggered.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <button data-toggle=".clock_inside" class="btns">The clock is still not ticking</button>

                    <div class="clock_inside">
                        <p>Even if the clock is straightened, the pendulum does not seem to move. Confused, you open the
                            clock's pendulum door to examine its innards.
                            You gasp! There is a sheet wedged against the pendulum. </p>
                        <p>As you unfold it, you see the sheet of paper is referring to some kind of maths problem (you
                            grimace). There are handwritten notes and question
                            marks and it looks like the note was ripped off a newspaper.</p>

            <p>You have a close look at the wedding picture. The lady on the left has a beautiful white dress and
                the man looks a bit stiff in his fancy outfit. The picture has aged well and is enclosed in an
                elaborated wooden frame.
                The frame is bulky and is hung securely on the wall.</p>

                            much about
                            them. </p>

            My obligations won't keep me away
            from you too long, I dare hope. I left a treasure for you to find, my love, if you come to miss me. It is
            hidden where:

                <li>Time stops for our battles of wit.</li>

                <li>I move brazenly towards you.</li>
                <li>But you know how to stop my foolish plans.</li>
                <li>I kneel in front of your beauty.</li>
